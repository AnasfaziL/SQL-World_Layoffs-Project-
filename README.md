💻 SQL Projects – Data Cleaning & Analysis
📁 Project 1: Data Cleaning with SQL
In this project, I worked with a layoffs dataset and performed the following tasks:

Created staging tables to safely clean the data

Removed duplicate records using ROW_NUMBER()

Standardized company, industry, and country names

Converted date columns into proper DATE format

Handled null and blank values

Cleaned and prepped the dataset for analysis

📊 Project 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with SQL
Using the cleaned data, I explored various insights such as:

Companies with the highest number of layoffs

Industries and countries most affected

Year-wise and month-wise layoff trends

Total funds raised by companies and their impact on layoffs

Ranking companies by layoffs using DENSE_RANK()

Monthly rolling totals using CTEs and window functions

🛠 Tools Used:
MySQL

SQL functions: JOIN, GROUP BY, WINDOW FUNCTIONS, CTE, UPDATE, STR_TO_DATE(), and more

Happy to hear feedback or suggestions 😊
